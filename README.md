# KSU SWE 3643 Software Testing and Quality Assurance Semester Project: Web-Based Calculator

This repository contains the work done as part of the Spring 2024 semester project at Kennesaw State University for the class SWE 3643 Software Testing and Quality Assurance. The aim of the project was to apply the knowledge gained over the course of the semester by creating testable code, as well as testing that code. The repository gives detailed instructions of how to set up the [Environment](#environment) for application use, as well as perform Unit and End-To-End tests on the code using NUnit and Playwright.
